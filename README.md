=============

Here is my personal website, samueljrains.com

I wrote the page (as a test) in python.  It had originally been developed in PHP, but I went out on a limb to test my (minor) Python abilities.  The formatting looks kinda funky, but it's all there!  I did this to expand my knowledge of Python in addition to what I already know of PHP.

Let me know if you have any questions or comments regarding the site.  Thanks for looking.
