=============

Here is my personal website, samueljrains.com

I wrote the page (as a test) in python.  It had originally been developed in PHP, but I went out on a limb to test my (minor) Python abilities.  Looks kinda funky, but it's all there!  
Let me know if you have any questions or comments regarding the site.  Thanks for looking.
