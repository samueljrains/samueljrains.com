=============

Here is my personal website, samueljrains.com

I've rewritten my site utilizing several languages and plugins.  It had originally been developed in PHP, but I went out on a limb to test my (minor) Python abilities.  Now, the code base is primarily PHP but has some JavaScript, jQuery, and some AJAX for good measure.

In the site, I used several JS and CSS package.  Acknowledgments:
* Bootstrap - <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a>
* jQuery - <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery">jQuery</a>
* Alertify - <a href="https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js">Alertify</a>
* Prism - <a href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/prism">Prism</a>

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.  Thanks for looking.
