=============

Here is my personal website, samueljrains.com

I wrote the page (as a test) in python.  It had originally been developed in PHP, but I went out on a limb to test my (minor) Python abilities.  The code formatting might look kinda funky, but it's all there!  I did this to expand my knowledge of Python in addition to what I already know of PHP.

In the site, I used several JS and CSS package.  Acknowledgments:
* Buutstrap - <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a>
* jQuery - <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery">jQuery</a>
* Alertify - <a href="https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js">Alertify</a>
* Prism - <a href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/prism">Prism</a>

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.  Thanks for looking.
